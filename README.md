## TIMEBOT

This is a very simple groupme bot that is used to make checking friends local times easier. With
people going on vacation and studying abroad sometimes it is difficult to keep track of everyone's
local times.

It works by taking the current UTC time and applying an offset using the 
[time](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-time) package.

This project takes most of its code and structure from the 
[example](https://github.com/groupme/bot-tutorial-nodejs) project provided by groupme
